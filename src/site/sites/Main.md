# What is Edita?

Edita is an Android-only app that allows you to transform text, either by holding it and clicking *Edita* in the context menu or via Share and the share menu. Via the context menu, you just press *Paste* and the text is replaced. With share, the text is copied into your clipboard and you have to paste it yourself.

If you just want one specific effect, like **bold**, you can just hold this panel for a quick edit.

### "Why is the Edita option not shown on....?"

I'm very sorry to hear that; however, I can't do much about it. The Android system (and developers of apps) have complete control over what context menu is shown where. This is why the share option exists.

Thank you for using my app, and if you have any feedback, feature requests, etc., just send a mail to edita@robingebert.com.
